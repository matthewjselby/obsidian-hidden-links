# Hidden Links Plugin for Obsidian

Sometimes a link is just a link, and you don't want to form a relationship between two notes. This plugin allows for creating internal links that *do not show up in the graph*. There are many cases where one might want to link two notes but leave the graph unaffected, as discussed (here)[https://forum.obsidian.md/t/links-that-do-not-affect-graph/28851]. This plugin aims to provide nearly identical functionality to built in links - autocomplete, real-time styling, and auto-updating links when files are renamed. The only difference is that these links do not show up in the graph!
